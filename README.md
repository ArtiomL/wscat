Examples
--------

If you ever used `nc`, `wscat` works pretty much the same.

### Connect to a server

```
$ wscat echo.websocket.org
Hello
Hello
Who's there?
Who's there?
^D

```

### Chat

Server:

```
$ wscat -l 12345
Hi there!
Hi!
It's nice to speak to someone who just dosn't repeat everything I say back at me.
Yeah! Isn't it?!
Sorry, gotta run...
^D

```

Client:

```
$ wscat localhost:12345
Hi there!
Hi!
It's nice to speak to someone who just dosn't repeat everything I say back at me.
Yeah! Isn't it?!
Sorry, gotta run...
```

### Transfer a file

Server:

```
$ wscat -b -l 12345 < ~/Desktop/mycat.jpg
```

Client:

```
$ wscat -b localhost:12345 > igotacat.jpg
```

Note that you can have the client send the file as well, after the connection has been setup `wscat` does not differentiate between server/client.

### Get your bitcoin on

```
$ echo '{"op":"unconfirmed_sub"}' | wscat -k wss://ws.blockchain.info/inv
```

The `-k` option is used to keep the socket open after the command has been sent, allowing us to read the continuous stream of bitcoin transactions.
